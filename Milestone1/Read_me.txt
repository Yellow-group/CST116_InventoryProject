For this weeks project, I collaborated with Kenneth and Cory to come up with a plan for our project and create the
requirements document. I created a github account for our group, as well as ensured that the URL is provided for the 
project in this read_me. Using the questions and answers provided by Cory, I was able to come up with the functionality 
that the program will need to have for this client. I added the visual display of the different cases that will need to 
exist within the program to allow different functions depending on login credentials. I put the parts of the word document
together prior to pushing it to the group git repository.
